# The asterisk (*) is a placeholder indicator and its corresponding mapping
# attribute is created in the output file.  The following example creates
# 2 attributes (P1 and P2), if uncommented.  The value
# of P1 and P2 will be "Placeholder 1" and "Placeholder 2", resctively.
#
#  *    P1                     // Placeholder 1
#  *    P2                     // Placeholder 2
