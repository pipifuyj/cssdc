# The asterisk (*) is a placeholder indicator and its corresponding mapping
# attribute is created in the output file.  The following example creates
# 2 attributes (P1 and P2), if uncommented.  The value
# of P1 and P2 will be "Value of P1" and "Value of P2", resctively.
#
#P1                 *                  // Value of P1
#P2                 *                  // Value of P2
